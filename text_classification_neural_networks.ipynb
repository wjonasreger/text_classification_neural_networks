There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love ? Or who , say , know the self-involved white people in love ? I know it's not the love Crash of anvil-tastic inclusiveness but you can't pretend to have a cinematic New York with out these fairly prevalent members of society . Plus , you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that ham-handed Oscar , so where is everyone ? <br /><br />Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters ( remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs ? Me either) . This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst . Bad acting , bad writing , bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants . <br /><br />But thank god they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back together for that Jumper reunion . And , side note , Uma dodged a bullet ; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged . This , of course , is one thing in terms of his looks , but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor , lovely Maggie Q.<br /><br />I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire , but it has to be the Anton Yelchin/ Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste , which saddens me because I really like those two actors . I don't consider myself easily offended , but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt . <br /><br />A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie . I don't mean opposite , I mean against . Against is the only explanation . I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight . HIGHLIGHT . Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits , which seem to be a nod to the first New York Real World . This film is embarrassing , strangely dated , inarticulate , ineffective , pretentious and , in the end , completely divorced from any real idea of New York at all . <br /><br />(The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman/ Eli Wallach sequence , as it is actually quite sweet , but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless , masturbatory torment. ) \n",

            "Sample text: Although critically maligned , Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen . It's a movie that should be watched closely ; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them . For instance , keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of the pricing gun at the pet store...and also on the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of scenes . It's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly , even though you know it's a comedy . Amy Heckerling , the director , is really sharp here--If you enjoyed her better known films ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High , Clueless , European Vacation , etc.,)you should give this one a look.<br /><br />Michael Keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast ( Griffin Dunne , Maureen Stapleton , Joe Piscopo , Peter Boyle ) is excellent . Highly recommended . \n",

            "Sample text: Surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tag-line , “The most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time” , isn’t even properly exploited ! Although this film was regularly shown on TV in my neck of the woods since my childhood days , its notoriety ( for awfulness not erotic content , mind you ) kept me away from it until now – and I only relented because I have recently enjoyed Bo Derek’s previous film , 10 ( 1979) , and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the Christmas period.<br /><br />Lead actress/producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl-ish sexual innocent ( witness the inept banana scene ) and , as was to be expected , she is made to get her clothes off a few times but , as welcome as these scenes were , she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here ; Richard Harris , then , chews the scenery incessantly as Jane’s obsessed explorer father , but John Philip Law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in Jane herself ; newcomer Miles O’Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie , is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel ( which is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway! ) and , furthermore , is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film’s second half! ; for the record , he later starred in two ATOR movies ( or would-be CONAN imitators ) for Joe D’Amato and the King Arthur-era set , SWORD OF THE VALIANT ( 1984).<br /><br />When still an actor , director John Derek ( who also serves as his own cinematographer here ) had worked with some good film-makers ( Cecil B . De Mille , William Dieterle and Robert Rossen ) and a few great ones ( Otto Preminger , Nicholas Ray and Don Siegel ) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability : appallingly pretentious at times ( witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence ) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions ; this was Derek’s seventh film as a director ( and his second of four with wife Bo ) and , eventually , he would only get to make two more.<br /><br />The film’s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the Tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in GREYSTOKE : THE LEGEND OF TARZAN , LORD OF THE APES ( which , surprisingly enough , I haven’t watched myself yet ) – a mere three years later! ! Nominated for six Razzie Awards ( including John Derek , Richard Harris and Miles O’Keeffe ) and winning one for Bo Derek herself , TARZAN , THE APE MAN was co-written by Gary Goddard , the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a ( this time animated ) heroic figure , MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE ( 1987 ) which I will be revisiting presently as well ( yay) ! Despite a charming closing credit sequence showing Tarzan and Jane playing with around with an orang-utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion , any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting Bo completely white and , fatally , John Derek’s clear disinterest in the character of Tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie! ! \n",
